    "## 0.1 The Data\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset consists of several hundred residential properties in Utrecht and includes structural, spatial, and energy-related features.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some of the key variables include, for more details refer to the `codebook.txt`:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "retailvalue – estimated market value of the property (our main prediction target)\n",
    "\n",
    "taxvalue – assessed value used for taxation purposes\n",
    "\n",
    "house-area, lot-area, garden-size – size-related features\n",
    "\n",
    "bathrooms, buildyear – structural characteristics\n",
    "\n",
    "energy-eff – energy efficiency indicator\n",
    "\n",
    "monument – whether the property is a protected historical building\n",
    "\n",
    "zipcode, x-coor, y-coor – location information\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Together, these variables describe both the physical properties of homes and aspects related to sustainability and urban geography.\n",
    "\n",
    "Dataset is not split to training/test but we will use one common seed (to rule all splits).\n",
    "\n",
    "### 0.1.1 Housing Valuation and Fairness\n",
    "\n",
    "🌍 In many countries, including the Netherlands, property values are used to determine: property taxes, mortgage conditions, insurance costs.\n",
    "\n",
    "💰 These values are often estimated using statistical or machine learning models that take into account characteristics such as size, location, and building quality.\n",
    "\n",
    "🎯 While predictive accuracy is important, valuation models can also have distributional consequences. Systematic overvaluation or undervaluation of homes in certain areas or categories (e.g., energy-efficient homes, historic buildings, or specific neighborhoods) can lead to: higher tax burdens for some residents, unfair advantages for others.\n",
    "\n",
    "🧪 In this clinic, we will not only aim to build accurate predictive models, but also examine who benefits and who may be harmed by modeling errors.\n",
    "\n",
    "🏠📊 By analyzing residuals and group-wise error patterns (e.g., by zipcode, energy efficiency or monument status), we will reflect on how fairness can be understood in the context of housing valuation. That will also serve as a good basis for the guest lecture we are going to have on March 9th."

These spatial neighborhoods provide a more flexible and fine-grained representation of location than zipcode alone.\n",
