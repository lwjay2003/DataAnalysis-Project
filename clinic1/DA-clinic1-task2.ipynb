This is the essence of this course and of the skills you should try build for yourself: Many people can run fancy models these days but not many people can interpret the results correctly.

    "Freshly graduated from a top Dutch university in Limburg, you are hired by the Dutch government to advise on a large-scale “education innovation” initiative code-named \"FIETS\" (Flexibele Innovatie voor Efficiënte Toepassing in Scholing). With higher education facing severe budget cuts, the government is looking for creative solutions to \"do more with less.\" Convinced by the stunning progress in language modeling, officials believe LLMs could help battle growing teacher shortages and reduce costs by automating parts of the education process. Your job description: investigate which LMs might be best suited to plug the gaps without draining the budget!\n",
    "\n",
    "You are handed the results of three LMs on the [“Massive Multitask Language Understanding (MMLU)”](https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.03300) dataset  to compare. This famous dataset consists of 57 subjects with multiple-choice questions, covering diverse subjects like mathematics, computer science, history, and law. Most providers of state-of-the-art LMs use this dataset to showcase the versatility of their latest models. Unfortunately, the intern responsible for collecting the results, didn’t pay attention during DACS KEN3450: Data Analysis. As a result, the collected datasets are slightly corrupted. Jammer!\n",

    "The success of FIETS depends on your ability to make sense of the messy data and recommend the best model to keep the Dutch education system pedaling forward—despite uphill challenges like funding shortages and a skeptical academic community!\n",

    "### A very brief primer on Language Models\n",
    "We studied LLMs in the context of the NLP course but here is a short reminder. Language models (LMs) are sophisticated statistical models designed to understand and generate human-like text. At their core, LMs are trained to predict the most likely continuation of a given input text. For example, given the input \"The cat sat on the,\" an LM might predict \"mat\" as a likely continuation.\n",
    "LMs are trained on vast text samples from various sources, including books, websites, and social media. This extensive training allows them to capture patterns and relationships in language, enabling them to generate coherent and contextually appropriate text across a wide range of topics and styles.\n",
    "\n",
    "While LMs can produce text that appears to be written by intelligent humans, it's important to note that their capabilities can diverge from human intelligence in unexpected ways. They may sometimes generate factually incorrect information or struggle with complex reasoning tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "Two key concepts in understanding LMs are:\n",
    "1. **Tokens**: LMs process text using \"tokens\" rather than individual characters. Tokens can be words, parts of words, or punctuation marks. For example, the sentence \"I love AI!\" might be tokenized as [\"I\", \"love\", \"AI\", \"!\"]. Tokenization is the first step in both training and using an LM.\n",
    "2. **Context**: The input text provided to an LM is called the \"context.\" This context informs the model's predictions or generations. A longer or more specific context often leads to more accurate and relevant outputs.\n",
    "\n",

    "It looks like the accuracy depends a lot on which letter is the correct answer, and the pattern is almost identical in both datasets. This suggests it isn’t noise, but rather a systematic effect. Model X is extremely good when the correct answer is A (~0.97 in both datasets), but its accuracy drops steadily toward D (~0.60–0.63). This looks like a strong preference/bias toward earlier options (especially A). Model Y shows the opposite pattern: it performs best when the correct answer is D (~0.90–0.92), and is noticeably worse on A/B/C (~0.62–0.76). That suggests a bias toward D (or toward later options). Model Z is comparatively stable across A–D (roughly mid-0.64 to 0.68), with only small differences. It looks less sensitive to which letter is correct.\n",

    "The shuffled MMLU results show clear model-specific answer-letter biases. Model X answers “A” much more often than the other letters, while model Y strongly favors “D”; in contrast, model Z is close to uniform across A–D. The conditional accuracies suggest these are not harmless preferences: X is relatively weak when it outputs its frequent default “A” but is extremely accurate when it rarely outputs C/D, which looks like it only chooses those letters when it has strong evidence. Y shows the opposite problem: it overuses “D”, but its accuracy when answering “D” is low, so this bias likely hurts its overall performance; when it answers A/B it is much more reliable. Overall, even after shuffling, the models’ predictions depend heavily on the answer letter they choose, supporting the idea that part of the observed performance is driven by answer-option/position bias rather than purely question understanding."
